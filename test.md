Git next steps
===
 - [] set up post commit triggers?

Things I learned
 + don't try to combine unrelated histories (if you
 do, workaround is to --allow-unrelated-histories
 + maloc error on pt is probably due to memory limits 
 + on stout, need to use a git dotkit (GIT-2.11 works, maybe can use older?)
 + set up origin with Personal access token for authentication
