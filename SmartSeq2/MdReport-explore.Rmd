Set up
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
report = "/gsap/assembly_analysis/SSF/SmartSeq2/SSF-11912/SSF-11912_SmartSeqAnalysisV1.1_1/SSF-11912_SmartSeqAnalysisV1.1_1.1507041315376.MdReport.tsv"
df <- read.table(
  file = report,
  sep="\t",
  header=T,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(rRNArate ~ expt, data = df ,las=2,
  ylab = "rRNA rate",
  main = "Average rRNA rate across SS2 projects"
)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
